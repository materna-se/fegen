# ðŸ§¹ FeGen for Spring Boot

FeGen generates frontend code based on your Spring backend, so you can consume your Spring Data REST API in a type safe manner.
Typescript and Kotlin are supported as frontend languages, so FeGen helps you create a web app, a native Android app or another Spring application.

**If you are new to FeGen, have a look at the [Documentation](https://materna-se.github.io/fegen/).**

An example project demonstrating the usage of FeGen can be found in the git submodule `fegen-examples`.



## Features

FeGen plugins are available for Gradle as well as Maven.
Code generated by FeGen enables you to access the following Spring features:

- Call CRUD operations on `JpaRepository`s while using pagination and sorting
- Fetch multiple related entities in one API call using projections
- Use repository- as well as custom searches to only access entities matching certain criteria
- Call custom endpoints

Code can be generated for the following target platforms:

- Typescript (To be used in e.g. a React app)
- Kotlin
    - Inter service (To be used in another Spring application)
    - Android



## Limitations / Roadmap

FeGen currently has some limitations such as the following which may be lifted in future versions:

- Embeddables can be used, but they may only contain primitive types since references to other entities are not yet supported
- A plugin for Swift (to use in iOS apps) exists, but is not yet publicly released
- Generating code for API endpoints used to up- or download files is not supported
- There are some tests for the generated code, however, currently no CI/CD pipeline exists



## Building FeGen

Clone this repository if you haven't already using

```shell script
git clone --recurse-submodules
```

If you have not used the `--recurse-submodules`, execute the following in the cloned directory:

```shell script
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If you want to use a custom build of FeGen, you can install all FeGen plugins to your local `.m2` directory by running the following command in the root project:

```
gradle publishToMavenLocal
```

To include the built plugins in a gradle project, insert `mavenLocal()` as a repository in the buildscript in `build.gradle`.

Tests are included in the `fegen-examples` directory and can be run by executing the following commands:

```
cd fegen-examples
./gradlew build
``` 

The `fegen-examples` directory consists of a gradle project that contains the line `includeBuild '..'` in its `settings.gradle`.
This causes it to use gradle's composite build feature and ensures that the example and tests inside it always use the FeGen instance built from the sources in the directory where this `README.MD` resides.

The source code of FeGen is split into two gradle subprojects that correspond to the frontend languages that code can be generated for.
Additionally, `fegen-core` contains the code that is independent of the target language.
Each of these directories contain two sub projects that contain code that is specific to maven and gradle respectively.
